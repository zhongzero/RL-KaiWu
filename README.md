# Tencent Kaiwu Arena

> This is the final project of CS3316(Reinforcement Learning) in Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

## Team Members

- [Yongshan Chen](https://github.com/EternalFir): Guided the research process, proposed the improvemnets on PPO algorithm and implemented  the PSRO algorithm.
- [Lai Jiang](https://github.com/jianglai-0023): Write the Abstract, Introduction and Conclusion part of the paper. Propose the structure of the paper.
- [Yuhao Wang](https://github.com/Jerx2y): Checked feasibility of truly PPO mechanism and implemented the PPO-RB part in codes. Finished the truly PPO part in introduction, related work, methods and conclusion section.
- [Linhao Zhong](https://github.com/zhongzero): Run the experiment, refine the parameter and evaluate the model. Write the Section 4.2, 4.3 and part of introduction.
- [Binglin Zhou](https://github.com/Zhou-bl): Run the experiment, refine the parameter and analysis the evaluation result. Write the Section 4.1, 4.4.

## Setup

First, you should upload the code to the Kaiwu Arena platform. Then, you can run the experiment by just running the following command:

```bash
python3 train_test.py
```

## Acknowledgement

We would like to thank the course instructor, Prof. Weinan Zhang, TA Xialin He and Kaiwu Arena for providing the platform for this project.
